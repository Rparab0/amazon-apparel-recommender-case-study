A powerful Content-Based Recommendation System for Apparel, leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques. It suggests similar apparel products based on textual features and image similarity, providing personalized and relevant recommendations to users.

## Problem Statement ü§î

The objective of this project is to build a recommendation engine that can suggest apparel products similar to the given product. The engine uses a combination of textual features such as title, brand, color, type, and more, along with image similarity to determine the product recommendations.

## Objective üîç

The main goal of this recommendation system is to enhance the shopping experience of users by providing them with personalized apparel recommendations. It leverages various natural language processing and machine learning techniques to understand the characteristics of different apparel products and make relevant suggestions.

## Key Features

- Textual feature extraction and processing
- Image similarity analysis
- Cosine similarity for content-based clustering
- Enhanced shopping experience through personalized recommendations
